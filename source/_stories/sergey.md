During my high school years, I started learning HTML and CSS. I liked that as soon as I changed something, I could
immediately see the result.

When my first “website” (actually, it was literally a couple HTML pages) started to have navbars, header, and other
cross-cutting elements, I learned about PHP.

It was something simple, based on a GET parameter I would get the current page and update the content based on that.
For a high school kid, it was magic!

A lot of time has passed since then, my scripts have gotten a bit more complex,
but I still get excited like a kid working with PHP.

And though PHP is constantly dying... What do we say to the god of death? Not today.
